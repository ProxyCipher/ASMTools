     Recreating linux commands in pure assembly x86-64

   This repository focuses on Linux programming using assembly x86-64.
I made this project to strengthen my understanding of assembly and linux.

------------------------- [ RESOURCES ] -------------------------

In case you do not know where I am getting those numbers from, I recommend checking these websites:

- Linux syscall table:
  https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/constants/syscalls.md#x86_64-64_bit

- Linux manual page:
  https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/

------------------------------------------------------------------

 If you are curious why this does not have a modern-looking README file, it's because
assembly is a low-level, old programming language, and I wanted to convey that feeling.
